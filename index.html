<h5><b>This is an alternate account of @kit2d2 to host projects</b></h5>

Hello! I am currently working on several projects of my own, but in the meantime I am hosting some projects (most of which don't work ðŸ˜­) on my alternate account to connect people to simple but immersive digital experiences.

If you would like to contact me, email me at azelifyofficial@gmail.com

My Discord account is currently facing some issues, however I will try and fix them ASAP.

My Current Plans: 

<ul><li>Add more games and potentially a proxy (For educational purposes only ðŸ˜‰)</li>
<li>Make Website Navigation (Currently you will have to manually type the link. You can view all the websites via the files in the repository or by clicking<a href=https://github.com/kit2d2alt/kit2d2alt.github.io>here</a>.</li>
</ul>
Chow!
